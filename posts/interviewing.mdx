Interviewing is, "Do we like them", or "Can they code". This means, other than the outliers in *FAANG*, most companies will lead into an interview process with one or the other. It sucks. You would think after however many years I have been in this profession, some sort of standard would have been set. Let me give two scenarios of how a basic structure of an interview goes.   

### Coding

In this scenario, we've already got past the HR, or recruitment. No matter how much you try to have them explain the interview process, it's usually not what you were told when showing up to the first technical portion with an actual team member. Why is this? I have no clue. But hopefully you make sure to underdstand that there will be some sort of coding within a shared screen.

You join the virtual meeting. One more more people are on the other end of the monitor. You introduce yourself, and then it's time. They only have about an hour to decide weither you are worthy of working with them, so there is not a lot of wiggle room for getting comfotable. I hate this. It happens for juniors and seniors alike. 

Sometimes they start off easy, wrtie a basic function that adds an alert to a button. Maybe a counter. Other times, it's data structures and algorythms. Either way, it's uncomfortable. the question is never the same. it's not like you get some requirements beforehand. It's whatever the engineer thinks up. It's called 'dynamic programming'. This is where you think on-the-go. you must figure out the solution while be watched and judged. 

The key points here are to make sure you not only practice solving solutions (leet-code, as well as common common implementations), but also find a partner to maybe practice with. I don't see enough articles pushing the fact that without practicing solving a solution in from of a friend, it never becomes easy to perform like this. Any job I've worked at has never expected me to code up a solution while being stared at. Come to think of it, I've never really had to really solve a solution without understanding the problem first and estimating out the time it would take and... nevermind. the point it to practice having someone throw random challenges at you and solving them. You'll never really find a pattern as to what type of question each company will ask.

I fail at this, horribly. One time, I was interviewing for a position at GitLab. I was petrified my first time but the guy knew I had the knowledge, so allowed me to retake the coding portion. Thankfully he went over the same question, so when I passed. It was simply because of the .
