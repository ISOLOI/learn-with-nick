title: What is this? Intro to My Bare Hands

 With enough blogs to make an AI model timeout, I am writing this for me. For experience, and a resume. I got caught up after covid. I made a lot of changes from inwards that I haven't expressed outwards. 

What is my profession? Javascript. I work with Javascript to build applications for the front and backend. I'm self-taught. This means I didn't have many mentors. By the time I started worming professionally, I was being looked at for solutions. This was a bad idea. Later on as I started building up courage to ask more and more questions, it would feel as if I was inexperienced. What a crazy world.

I will be answering a lot of questions I've had throughout my career that I should have asked early on. Hopefully I keep this up to date and just maybe it will help someone else.

I have A.D.D. I'm introvert. I tell noone. It ruins interviewing. I have had success, obviously. But it's also gotten in the way.
